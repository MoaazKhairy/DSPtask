# DSP - MATLAB
# Combination between magnitude and phase for 2 images 
## This is project in 3rd year in Digitl Signal Processing (DSP)
## Project obejective: obtain the most effective component that magnitude or phase
## Project requirements:
- Make GUI in matlab to upload 2 images and occur the processing on it
- combine between magintude & phase of 2 distinctive images 
- show that phase more effective than magitude
